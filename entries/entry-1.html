      Mean Girls (2004) directed by Mark Waters and written by Tina Fey, Mean Girls follows Cady Heron, a homeschooled teenager navigating the cutthroat social jungle of high school and the iconic clique known as “The Plastics.” It’s a sharp, funny take on peer pressure and identity, showing how easily people change just to fit in.
Lindsay Lohan was first cast as Regina George, but the team swapped her to Cady — she was too likable to play the villain. Rachel McAdams, ten years older than most of her co-stars, brought a cool confidence that made Regina’s manipulation feel effortless. Amanda Seyfried had auditioned for Regina too, but her wide-eyed sweetness made her a perfect Karen.
The film captures real teenage group behavior — the need for status, imitation, and control. It’s not just a comedy; it’s a study of how power and belonging twist people in subtle, funny, and painfully real ways. Tina Fey made all cast members take a “real” high-school survey before filming, where they had to describe their social group and worst experiences with popularity or bullying. A lot of those answers influenced small lines and reactions in the movie.
